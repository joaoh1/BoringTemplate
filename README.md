# Boring Template

This is my personal template, it's specially made for my own needs, and therefore, it's not suited to other human beings (however, you can still use it, if you don't mind the personal tweaks). This is a fork of the [Fabric Example Mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod), which is more generic, therefore, a better template for regular human beings.

## Usage

You should be able to setup BoringTemplates for your own usage by the same way you setup the Fabric Example Mod template. The mysterious `₢id` should not be questioned but it should be replaced with a real mod id.

## License

This template, like the original template which this is based on, is available under the CC0 license. A copy of the MIT license is contained in this repository as a personal quality-of-life feature and it isn't applied on this template.
