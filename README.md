# Boring Template

This is my personal template, it's specially made for my own needs, and therefore, it's not suited to other human beings (however, you can still use it, if you don't mind the personal tweaks). This is a fork of the [Fabric Example Mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod), which is more generic, therefore, a better template for regular human beings. This template also borrows [Blueprint's](https://github.com/FabLabsMC/Blueprint) GitHub Actions/Packages integration, most of the integration is directly (or indirectly) from there.

## Usage

You should be able to setup BoringTemplates for your own usage by the same way you setup the Fabric Example Mod template. The mysterious `crid` should be replaced with a real mod id and `build.gradle` must be changed in order to reflect the mod's actual repository.
